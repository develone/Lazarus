This repository contains the Ultibo edition of the Lazarus IDE.

Based originally on Lazarus 1.6RC1 with changes to support the Ultibo target
and remove unwated items which are not relevant to building applications with
Ultibo core.

To build the IDE from source the process is the same as the Lazarus documentation
with the released version built using:

make clean all

from within the top level directory.

Note that you do not need to download the Lazarus source to use Ultibo core, the
neccessary parts of the source along with the compiled binaries are all included
in the Ultibo core installer download.
